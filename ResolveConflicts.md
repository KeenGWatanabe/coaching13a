The error message indicates that there is a **merge conflict** in the `utils.py` file. This happens when Git cannot automatically merge changes from the `prod` branch into your current branch because the same part of the file has been modified differently in both branches.

Here’s how you can resolve the conflict:

---

### Steps to Resolve the Merge Conflict:

1. **Check the status of the conflict:**
   Run the following command to see which files have conflicts:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   You’ll see `utils.py` listed under "Unmerged paths."

2. **Open the conflicting file (`utils.py`):**
   Open the file in a text editor or IDE. You’ll see conflict markers like this:
   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   // Changes from the current branch (the branch you're on)
   =======
   // Changes from the prod branch
   >>>>>>> prod
   ```

3. **Resolve the conflict:**
   - Decide which changes to keep (or combine them if needed).
   - Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`).
   - Save the file after resolving the conflict.

4. **Mark the conflict as resolved:**
   After fixing the conflict, stage the file:
   ```bash
   git add utils.py
   ```

5. **Complete the merge:**
   Commit the merge once all conflicts are resolved:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```
   Git will automatically use a default commit message for the merge, but you can modify it if needed.

6. **Push the changes (if needed):**
   If you’re working with a remote repository, push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

### Example Workflow:
```bash
# Check which files have conflicts
git status

# Open utils.py and resolve the conflict
nano utils.py

# After resolving, stage the file
git add utils.py

# Commit the merge
git commit

# Push the changes (if working with a remote repository)
git push origin main
```

---

### Additional Notes:
- If you want to abort the merge and return to the state before the merge attempt, run:
  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  ```
- If you’re unsure how to resolve the conflict, you can use a merge tool like `meld`, `kdiff3`, or the built-in tools in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).
